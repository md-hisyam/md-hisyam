Hey Damian,

I figured you'd remote into this web server after the call with SecOps regarding Ticket#2023012398704230, and I wanted to give you some additional context about the unusual activity they reported:

1. This server is our public-facing GitLab server that needs maintenance and upgrading.

2. You could look at the available logs in /var/log/gitlab/, but I suggest looking into /var/log/gitlab/nginx/access.log and searching for suspicious web browser activity first.

3. Unfortunately, this server is not managed frequently, and we have yet to configure the log forwarding to SIEM-02 with rsyslog though it is commented in the config, so you might need to collect the logs manually.

4. You can check the logrotate configuration of this server at /etc/logrotate.d/ and the components of our gitlab instance at /var/opt/gitlab/logrotate/logrotate.d/ if needed.

5. I'm still coordinating with SecOps to get more specific information about the alert they saw, but apparently, there may be someone persistently scanning our GitLab server.

Cheers, and I hope this helps!

- Perry

# Log Collection with rsyslog
1. Ensure rsyslog is installed
```
    sudo systemctl status rsyslog
```
2. Create a Configuration File
```
    gedit /etc/rsyslog.d/98-websrv-02-sshd.conf
    nano /etc/rsyslog.d/98-websrv-02-sshd.conf
```
3. Add the Configuration
    Add the following lines in /etc/rsyslog.d/98-websrv-02-sshd.conf to direct the sshd messages to the specific log file
```
$FileCreateMode 0644
:programname, isequal, "sshd" /var/log/websrv-02/rsyslog_sshd.log

```
4. save and close the conf file
5. restart the syslog ``sudo systemctl restart rsyslog``
6. Verify the Configuration: we can verify the configuration works by initiating an SSH connection to localhost via ``ssh localhost`` or by checking the log file after a minute or two.
